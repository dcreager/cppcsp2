To install C++CSP2 on POSIX-like systems:

[Unpack the tar - if you're reading this, you have probably done that]
Run "./configure"
Run "make"
It is advised that you run "make test" as well.  All tests should pass
Run "make install" (or "sudo make install") if you wish.

Run "make docs" to generate the documentation for the library - doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) required.
